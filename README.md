# Calibre Table-of-Content Sort Plugin

This plugin for the Calibre ebook-editor sorts the table of contents by the order in which they occur in the spine.
The plugin tries to maintain nesting as much as possible, but this cannot always be guaranteed.
Also note that chapters not in the spine and duplicate links will be removed.

## TODO:
- [ ] Add support for multiple links to the same file.
